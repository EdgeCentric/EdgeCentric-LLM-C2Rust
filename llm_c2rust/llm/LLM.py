When translating, please follow these guidelines:
- Only translate the code within the current context.
- Use the provided previous translation and signatures of related functions as references.
- Do not change parts of the previous translation that are unrelated to the current context unless absolutely necessary.
- If you modified parts of previous translation, please leave sufficient comments around the changes to explain your modifications.
- Your translation should be complete. Do not omit parts of the translation when they remain unchanged.
Your goal is to ensure the translation remains consistent across contexts while accurately reflecting the current context.
